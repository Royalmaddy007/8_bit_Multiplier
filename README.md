# 8_bit_Multiplier
This project involves designing and implementing an 8 x 8 multiplier using data path and control path on the Xilinx XC9572XL FPGA. The multiplier efficiently multiplies two 8-bit numbers, with inputs taken sequentially and stored in registers. The product is then displayed on a seven-segment display. This showcases expertise in digital logic, FPGA programming, and real-time computation.
